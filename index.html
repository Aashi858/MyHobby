        <p>My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 12 years old and read in class 7th standard. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.<br/>Through books reading nobody can feel alone and disturb. I think this habit is more precious than gold or other precious stones of the world. It provides us high level of knowledge, noble thoughts and ideas to work in many fields. Good and interesting books are like best friends of the one who like to read. The one who do not have this habit may possess worldly wealth but he/she would always be poor because of the lack of wealth of true knowledge.</p>
